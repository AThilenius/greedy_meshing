# Greedy Meshing Algorithm for Voxel Volumes

This repo exists purely as reference for anyone else trying to implement greedy
meshing. It is a cleanup of [this Javascript
implementation](https://github.com/mikolalysenko/mikolalysenko.github.com/blob/gh-pages/MinecraftMeshes/js/greedy.js)
which is from [this very math-heavy 0FPS
article](https://0fps.net/2012/06/30/meshing-in-a-minecraft-game/) also by
[Mikola Lysenko](https://github.com/mikolalysenko).

Unfortunately, I'm a bit slow, and found the source code unreadable. So I
rewrote it in something that looks a little less like C from 1980 üòâ

`‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note ‚ö†Ô∏è
This is totally untested (I've never run this code) it was just a reference to
then rewrite in Rust. If you use it please let me know if you found any issues,
or open a PR.`
